Understanding how dissimilatory sulfate reduction from diverse sulfate-reducing microorganisms can be generated with zero-valent sulfur(ZVS), as opposed to sulfate reduction to sulfide. Utilization of the ZVS pathways in processing sulfate can be induced at greater levels by increasing salinity of media for growing sulfate-reducing microorganisms. Furthermore, ZVS products produced by sulfate-reducing microorganisms can support the growth of other ZVS-metabolizing microorganisms, yielding its importance to the sulfur biogeochemical cycle.
